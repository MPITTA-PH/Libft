This was my first project as a 42 student. 
I had to rewrite several functions from the C standard library, such as strlen, strcpy, and atoi, 
as well as some utility functions like malloc and free. 
The goal was to understand how these basic functions work under the hood, improving my knowledge 
of memory management and function implementation in C. I also had to ensure that my functions were efficient and handled edge cases properly. 
This project was a great foundation for the rest of my cursus, as I would rely on these functions in later projects.
